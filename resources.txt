SUCCESS!!!

Finally got aquarium in vercel to build!!!
https://aquarium-project-git-main-davidhorphhotmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/

The problem was A LOT OF THINGS, mainly that it could not run dist.

What I need to do is:
1. npm i parcel --save dev as a dev dependency!!!
2. I need to also create a folder called "src".
3. I moved my index.html, my media (videos and pics), my css and my js INTO this src folder.
4. Inside package.json in the "scripts": {...} add these:
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build"
   Because you will now build with parcel.
5. I believe what I did next was npm run build or npm build and then a dist folder was created. This dist folder should have the stuff from your src folder.
6. Upload it to vercel

IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK...

Inside your Vercel, on this page:
https://vercel.com/davidhorphhotmailcoms-projects/aquarium-project
Go to settings on the right hand side of the tabs above. CLICK IT.

It will take you here:
https://vercel.com/davidhorphhotmailcoms-projects/aquarium-project/settings

Scroll down till you see the output directory and then:
7. On the right hand side, select "Override".
8. Remove the 'dist' and then add a . (just add a period).
